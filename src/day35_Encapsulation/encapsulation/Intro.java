    Encapsulation : data hiding ,concept to hide data with in object
    outside class they do not jhave direct access to data , \once u hide data with in obj only current classs have direct acces of data
    how to hide data ?
    use private access modifier
    u should also be able to use data outside class even thou its not allowed to use outside calss
    encapsulation can do this by getter and setter
    the only way u need to read data is getter and and if u want to change data use setter
    Getter and setter


    whe u apply encap uu are hiding instrance variable by giving pribate access modifier
    getter returns [provide  spexific value assigned to instance variable
    always give right retruna type in getter
    when ever u want to read private data is by getter and u have to  give the same data type

// getter retrun value of private variable
// setter : changee data not return value and return type is void , need to pass a paramter in setter which is assigned as new data
