    /*


     in polymorphism u can only call feature of parent class / or interface so we need reference type casting in order to use feature of the object type
     in order to able to apply casting we need is a relationship


     the reason we name
     Animal animal1 = dog();
     instead of Animal dog = dog();
     because we need to make it generic a name whicg is applicableto all

     like WebDrivier driver not Webdriver ChromeDriver we need to give generic name
