    Array list was a data structure
    collection is also a dat strutcutr to store element

    three main data structure  :
    Array
    collection
    map

    collectio and map size is dynamic we cxan increase and decrease it but for array its ot possible  array size is fixed

    collection does not support primivite only support non primitive data type
    we used collection to store objects and this case what we have to do if we have to use primitive we hav eobjects i mean the wrapper classess
    so we have to convert it in wrapper classes


    there are more than one collections in jaba : definded for group of multiple classes abd interfaces
    all of them are groeable in nazse
    for ex in array list we add size increase when reemove size decrease
    but remember they all only support non primitive

    in order to use primitve we have to convert it into non primitve its called auto boxing

    iterable is not a data structure

    collection and below are all data structure see [pdf

    it has three  main interpfaces List queue and set
    Waht is interface in java ?
    we use it to providie additonal implemntation , and these three interface are being implementated to several different classeds
and these three interfaces has child interfaces
for example List interface being extended to arrayList
LinkededList and vector they have isrelationsship with collection



The point today is to focus on the interfaces and differences : imp for interview

LIST : child interface of collection
so when u create list u  can make object from array list linkedlist vector and stack
