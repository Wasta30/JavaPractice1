    Super lkeyword :
    child class has to call parent class constructor if the parent class constructor is deafult(no argument) there is no need to give super keyword but i
    if there is no default constructpr we have to


    single : one supoer class only having one sub class
    one child onnly



    hierachical : one parent multiple child classes
    one class can be extended by multpile classes
    and all of these class have something in common also they have uniuque  abilites too


    multi level inheritance :
    a parent can have a child and those child class also have child class for ex employee class
    can i create a person clas which contaaon anme age gender so we can do employee extend person class
    so here person becomes the parent class
    so person class extended by employee class ( see class notes day 37)
    employee child of person and tester , developer , teaher are child of employee
    the youngest one is the riches ( tester example on class notes)



    multiple inheritance : for exm class X
    when u use extend key word u can only extend one class
    for example

    class x extends Y, Z this is wrong
