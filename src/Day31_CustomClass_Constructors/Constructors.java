Bankaccount account1 = new Bankaccount()(Constructors )
in java everysinngle class has constructors
if u dont create constructor then compiler create it by yourself
what if i use contrutor
cpnst is a method we can use it to create all the instances
so dont need for the setInfo method
steInfo disadv is u have to call everytime for each object
const is a method and used to create instances inssated of setInfo method

constructpr name must be same with class name
