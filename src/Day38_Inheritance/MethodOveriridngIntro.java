public class MethodOveriridngIntro {
    /*
    mehtod over laoding : multiple different method having same name
    in order to overload paratmer must be different , u can do it in the same class
    u can overload any method in java even the main method also

    method overdinf :
    diff from method overloading
    u just have one method only
    for ex eat mthod in animal class inherit to sub classes is only taking one memory
    and when we need to make chages in that method or diff implementation in that speciifc method this is method overdidng
    if we continue to over ride mthod : means its the same method u just make changes so less memory \

    the action is same but diff implemention like dog cat fish eat in diff way
    lets say eat rice in animal does it mean every amimal eat rice no we need to make changes in subclass
    ;
    even thou implekention is diff but action is same like area is avction and calculationg area is diff
    so we give diff implemention to circle rectagle and this is overriding

every single class u create is bacha of object class
object class has is relation with every class , its mother of all class anf comes from lang packg
