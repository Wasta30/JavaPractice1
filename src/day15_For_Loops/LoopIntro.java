    // for loop :
    // for loop : sytarts with intialzitaion indicates starting point of loop
    // use it when dealing with a code fragmemnt which u want to use specofoc number of time
    //
    // lets say i want to print hello world 10 times, in thi case i can use for loops
    // if i dont know how many times i have to repeat it then i can not use for loops
    // initilzation is the strating point of loop and conitiong is ending point
    /// is cond false loops terminated
    // and its cond true it executes a statement and theres something called iterator which eventually leads the cond to false
    // for example i need to reach 5 so iterator helps to increase cond to 5th time and on 6th time its faliled
    // remember use it if u know how many times u will use it
    // if u give wrong cond or iterator then ur loop is considered as the infinte loop its going to run statemet foreve r

    // for intiliazztion u can use i variable , initilaiztion starts with nay number , doesnt matter
    // what matters is cond and iteration u are giving
    // iteration which u gacve must be capable of to make the condition false
    // otherwwise theres no poijt of iteration
