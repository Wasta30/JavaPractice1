// Custom method
        // how do u define method ?
        // forex : charAt, Subsstring etec
        //everytime we call method it perfoms some task for us
// so far we are using method which are already built in java
        // but what if there is a function is unique and not in built in class
        // for example u have method of reverse freq etc if u dont have method everytime u have to do the same approach again and again
        // so in order to make my code more useful i can group that code with in the block

        // custom method : is the one we are creating , not built in
        //
        /*
        Task:
		step1 : reverse "Java" // i have to use loop
		....

		step5: rverse "python"// loop
		...


		step10: reverse "Cydeo"// loop here also
		// so call a mehtod instead of creating a loop 10 times
		...

// how to declare method "
        // u need to create a method first and then place a code fragment u need to placce it inside method body
        // start method with acces modifier : in java there is 4 acces modifier
        // 1: public , 2: protected , 3: private , 4: default
        // but for now we will use public
        // after acces modifier we have static modifier
        // next give return type : void , also u can make method with it
        // then give method name : its simislar to naming varaible not start with digit
        // and it should be readable
        // then paranthesis
        // ACESS modifier
        // public : all classes can access , thats why we are able to acces code in github
        // if u use public in day 10 u can use it inn day 23 , it means it can be used later in other packages
        // if private only u can use
        // STatic modifeir
        // allow use to call method theorugh class name : for example from utility class we call toString class
// so for ex if u have a method in onne class and u have to use it in another class all u have to do it is call the class name
// void can not assign to variable , it doesn not return data
        // if u just want to execute a function use void
// onceu create method call it and use it , csll method with its name
        // Method is a fucntion for example main method
        // syntax of main mrhfos is public static void main (string [] arg)
