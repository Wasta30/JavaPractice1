    Is A relation vs Has A relation
    Method overriding



    Inheritance :
    used to create is arelation btw class
    knownn as easiest way to get rich
    it just inhert from other class and no need to create variable
    for ex dog class cat class fish class have commonn thingss between them in animals category and have same chaacterisitics
   name , breed , size, weight etc ,
    and beside that each animal have some specific characteristics
    with the help of inheritance i can create variable one time and use it in other class
    and this way we have less code and less memory usage
    such as in dog class i can only create unique characteristics same has cat has some unique charcteristics
    are the common feature are declared in one place
    if there is no inheritance we have to make 1000s of custom class now we have to go to one place to fix it in one place

    in order to be sure that dog fish cat inhert all the feature from animal vlass i have to extablish is A relation
    how to create Is Reation : use extends keyword
    is relation is know as child and parent calss relation
    sub class or syper class
    whichever class is left is child class and on right is parent class
    super class fetaure given to child class and each child class has its own attribute also
    when u create super class only common feature are placed in it for ex fly method is not for dog or cat
    inheritance allow the feature of one class to be inherited
     another class
if the variable is accesible then only its inherited (modifier) private can not be inherited to child class

constructor can not be inherited to child class because contsructor name must be same with class name
for ex animal class cont is Animal and for dog class the name of constructrr should be dog
