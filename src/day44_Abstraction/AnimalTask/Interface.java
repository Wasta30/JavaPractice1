    /*
    why we need interface ?
    if we have abstract class

    abstracxt class is parent it has  common features which can be inherited to each sub class
    so u can not put something which is not common for all sub class
    the reason we interface it gives us ability to probvide addtional methods or actions its like a blue print
    so everytime u need to provide additional method to provide to sub class
    its used to achivee 100 percent abstraction

    for ex in animal class u put all common feature
    for ex parrot and eagle  bot have fly method so i can make it in parent class usinf interface

    so we created dog cat class which are firendly aninnal
    so implents keyword is used whenever a class inherits something from interface
    the adv is to re usebale etc
    interface allow multiple interface
